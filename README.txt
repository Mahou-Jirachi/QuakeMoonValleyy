QuakeMoon Valley Meme Mod by Jira Uttarapong 

Vision: Harvest Moon/ Stardew Valley-like game, demo using Quake 4.

Player can walk up to NPC and trade "vegetables". Player can "plant" "vegetables" into the ground.


Deliverable List:
1) NPC-like Strogg (to act similar to Minecraft Villagers)
	- Could not for the life of me figure out how to make all hostiles non-hostile (original goal) 
	- Instead, to demo, spawns Kane Strogg that does not attack to act as "Villager"

2) Ability to trade items with Strogg
	- Can spawn items, but pick up does not work

3) Ability to farm (weapons into farm tools to till, plant, harvest) (mark terrain as farmland)
	- Does not work
