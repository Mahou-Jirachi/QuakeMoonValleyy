QuakeMoon Valley Meme Mod by Jira Uttarapong 

Vision: Harvest Moon/ Stardew Valley-like game, demo using Quake 4.

Deliverable List:
1) NPC-like Strogg (to act similar to Minecraft Villagers)
	- Could not for the life of me figure out how to make all hostiles non-hostile (original goal) 
	- Instead, to demo, spawns Kane Strogg that does not attack to act as "Villager"

2) Ability to trade items with Strogg
	
3) Ability to farm (weapons into farm tools to till, plant, harvest) (mark terrain as farmland)
